</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>While first coming into the spotlight with the article &quot;Tragedy of the Commons&quot;, commons is that which belongs to all: ideas, sunsets, water, air, etc. The question then arises regarding how do we manage these? Based on Harding, the assumption was that commons was a doomed endeavour, since humans are essentially selfish (see: game theory &amp; the prisoner&#39;s dilemma). However, Ostrom led an empirical study on how fisheries (also commons) were managed by fishermen and won a Nobel Prize for her work on commons management, highlighting <a target='_blank' href="http://www.onthecommons.org/magazine/elinor-ostroms-8-principles-managing-commmons">8 principles</a>—spoiler: people manage their commons quite well.</p>
<p>In the cultural sense, commons took a different turn when articulated with communication technologies. The commons now had a possibility to be manifested in different areas. One of these areas is, for instance, the circulating of academic materials amongst the public.</p>
<p>Commons-based peer-production of value is a term coined by Yochai Benkler. It is due to the falling costs of production means that digital information goods are increasingly produced in lieu of market compensation and property incentives. In other words, because individuals require so few resources to contribute to informational projects, they do not expect payment or property rights. Individuals essentially ‘gift’ their knowledge and informational labor to the public on sites including Wikipedia in return for ‘psychological well-being and gratification’ and ‘social connectedness’. For Benkler, this is nothing short of a new non-market and cooperative mode of producing economic value that is transforming Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations into The Wealth of Networks.</p>

</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>On one side, open-source retains some rights for use and distribution of the software (with possibly still traditional licenses), while free software doesn&#39;t have any conditions attached to it, except that anything created with its help should also be made publicly available.</p>
<p>Free software&#39;s approach is that there is no real reason for an economic incentive to be required when it comes to <em>making</em> software; people made software before it was commercial, and arguably people make <em>better</em> software when it is not commercial.</p>
<p>Related is how the software is built: both involved decentralized collaboration, but can still have a core team of contributors.</p>

</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><div>Both the consumption and creation of culture were heavily influenced by other technological advances which weren't related to communication technology (i.e. the internet). It stands in the wake of similar technological revolutions, such as the printing press (for books) as well as the gramophone (for music) and the film (for visual arts). As such, it is not so much the internet, but the computer which enabled a new way of doing things; with computing, it became incredibly easier to receive, create and distribute user-generated content.</div></div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">the purpose of copyright</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>why was copyright established in the first place?</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>To protect the invention of an individual, to act as an incentive to put in the work to &quot;advance the arts and sciences&quot;.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">regimes of copyright</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>iTunes changed everything.</p>
<p>on the one side, the MPAA and RIAA are preserving profit</p>
<p>on the other side, copyrighted use generates a different kind of value (cultural one, for good or for bad)</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>Is it stealing if the original owner doesn&#39;t lose their copy? The criminalization of computers and computer use, the downloading and uploading of copyrighted files, came at a moment when the entertainment industry failed to adjust to the new modes of distribution. It is with the advent of iTunes, and Digital Rights Management (DRM), that it became possible to enforce copyright law as it existed. In parallel with these DRM tools, the development of streaming, and thus the rise of lending over owning switched the market; it is now more important to have access to something, rather than to own it.</p>
<p>So copyright in itself is not technically censorship, as the only reasons for copyright to exist are monetary profit and &quot;the advancement of the arts&quot;, but copyright holders were the first to show that you can tie someone&#39;s digital identity to someone&#39;s legal identity. This is what iTunes did: you have a digital product tied to your account.</p>
<p>The question is also raised about cultural appropriation: how come copyright doesn&#39;t apply to Gucci when they copy the style of a homeless person?</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">regulating copyright</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>switching the focus from the users to the providers</p>
<p>the question is whether ISPs should be responsible for the content uploaded to their platform.</p>
<p>for copyright, perhaps, but this could be a dangerous jurisprudence.</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>The battle for copyright today is also the battle for the freedom of information. Because computers are by definition copying machines, making them more restrictive stifles their overall abilities (technical drawback) and because the penalties are so huge for copyright infrigements (legal drawback) that all actors would rather be overshooting their censorship target than undershooting their censorship target.</p>

<p>It also has a governance component: it decides how users should interact with one another.</p>
<p>Finally, it has a cultural impact: it changes how users behave in their lives and interactions with one another (twitter, tiktok, etc.)</p>
